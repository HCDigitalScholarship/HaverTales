> Whan that Aprill with his shoures sote<br>
> The drought of Marche hath perced to the rote…<br>
> Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimage…<br>

In “The General Prologue,” the narrator of *The Canterbury Tales* explains how the coming of Spring inspires people to go on pilgrimage. He meets a group of pilgrims at an inn, joins their company, and offers a detailed description of each member of the group. The narrator’s portraits are vivid and often satirical. Clothes, facial features, and behaviors are loaded with clues about social rank and commentary on spiritual health.

## Money Motivated  
by Jacob Landsberg, Haverford ‘21

A business student there was, as driven as they come,<br>
He spent his days in accounting, calculating sums. <br>
Yet, a second in class was a second misspent, <br>
Especially with networking events to frequent. <br>
After all, when C’s get degrees, <br>
Why would he waste time with Socrates?<br>
In a world where cash is king, <br>
“Business major” sure had a nice ring. <br>
With December arrived the flurry of snow, <br>
As his job interviews began to grow, <br>
He longed for a job that would overpay <br>
At Goldman or maybe B of A.  <br>
Waiting for his interviewer, palms sweating <br>
Hoping for that water the receptionist was getting. <br>
He had practiced his handshake a thousand times, <br>
Up the corporate ladder, he hoped to climb. <br>
He’d left econ to the academics and tryhards, <br>
Business, he knew, was the way into Vanguard. <br>
He was certainly worthy of the position, <br>
His LinkedIn page alone warranted admission. <br>
He’d put away his khakis and his polos—all in pink, <br>
Now he sat in suit and tie, complete with cufflinks, <br>
A jacket of black with pants to match, <br>
Shoes shone, without even a scratch, <br>
A white shirt, freshly ironed, and his look was done <br>
Straight out of “How to Get a Job, 101.” <br>
Yet, if he missed out on the job, it wouldn’t be too bad, <br>
He could always work at JP Morgan, thanks to dad.<br>

## The Pokémon Go Player  
by Helena Frisbie-Firsching, Haverford ‘21
 
There was a fellow arriving to Cope Field,<br>
A group of folks following at his heels.<br>
A battle they were to have, on the app<br>
Pokémon Go against the foe, pinap<br>
Berries used in the catch. Clad in warm hat<br>
And coat and red scarf, his outfit down pat<br>
To withstand the cold but also tap quick<br>
His phone screen and of his Pokémon pick<br>
A team with type advantage for the raid.<br>
He often comes to the motley group’s aid,<br>
In his pack is a portable charger;<br>
Cold’s unkind to phones. It’s bad to wager<br>
Raid rewards on batteries of low charge.<br>
His charging cable collection is large;<br>
He can lend for any model or make,<br>
If his Instinct gym they will not soon take.<br>
A normal glove or mitten he has none<br>
Rather the fingerless kind, which are fun<br>
And practical, so that he can keep most<br>
Of his hand comfortably warm, yet boast,<br>
Having dealt the most damage to Ho-Oh.<br>
And for this game which dearly he loves so,<br>
He will abandon his schoolwork for quests,<br>
Loitering at Stokes, not getting much rest.<br>
He is a physics major, as most are,<br>
His shoes worn from not traveling by car.<br>
Many kilometers a week walks he<br>
To hatch eggs and maybe catch a shiny.<br>
Always with his phone out and looking down,<br>
He scuttles his way throughout Havertown.<br>

## The Haverbro  
by Caroline Ford, Haverford ‘21
 
A HAVERBRO there was, an athlete, at that,<br>
A popular social caste in absence of a frat.<br>
Truly one who values social status and skill;<br>
This athlete cares most for FIFA and chill.<br>
A white boy, ™, with dirty blond hair,<br>
Tall in his stature, and pale face shaved bare.<br>
A regular at the GIAC to lift weights and run<br>
When outside of practices to condition,<br>
Always trying to remain hydrated<br>
With a gallon water jug, rather weighted.<br>
On the DC’s right side he, with Gatorade in hand,<br>
Would oft sit and embody the Nike brand.<br>
Lacrosse stick looped through his navy backpack,<br>
A ‘Ford sweatshirt he sported, bright red and black,<br>
Preppy Lacoste shorts, with Adidas shoes to match,<br>
So that any girl would think him quite a catch.<br>
A white snapback worn low atop his head<br>
While he sat with his legs generously spread;<br>
His position conveying confidence<br>
In both frank manner and ego immense,<br>
Surrounded by many of his fellow bros<br>
Discussing economics, I suppose.<br>
And alas, when the weekend arrives again, <br>
As parties come around, every now and then;<br>
A champion of pong, he plays through the night,<br>
And well can he consume much Natty Lite.<br>
He is full ready to drink, juul, and dance,<br>
And perhaps give his homework just one glance.<br>

## The Haverbro   
by Gwynne Dulaney, Bryn Mawr ‘20
 
There was but once a Haverbro<br>
Who loved to compliment his flow<br>
With slick hair gel and rich pomade<br>
So that his flow would never fade.<br>
On his shirt ‘twas so finely embossed<br>
His team name for baseball or lacrosse.<br>
And maybe a hoodie intended to match<br>
So that he would thus be considered a catch.<br>
And Airbuds placed within his ears<br>
So hoots and cries he could not hear.<br>
He was well-versed in all the sports<br>
Made clear to all by his fine gym shorts.<br>
For always this man looked never meek<br>
But always buff and quite on-fleek.<br>
He was down to party, and shed a tear<br>
If ever there lacked some ice-cold beer.<br>
And all he greeted in much good mood<br>
With a deep and illustrious cry of, “dude!”<br>
He showed his love but on a whim<br>
With offers to hit the Gardner gym.<br>
A worldly man, of deep deep thought<br>
He made it clear he knew a lot.<br>
For only a man who’s not a fool<br>
Knows it best to smoke a Juul.<br>
For no man of wit would willingly beget<br>
The health problems brought on by a cigarette.<br>
These bits of wisdom were brought to be<br>
By majoring in philosophy.<br>
And every day, like fine clockwork he went-y<br>
To eat ample amounts of chicken tendies.<br>
And all girls nearby would be in fear and dreading<br>
Of that much-too-common thing they call man-spreading.<br>
One thing bound to set him in a rage<br>
Was the unfair elimination of the stage<br>
That graced the room of the good DC<br>
How silly could this dear bro be?<br>
A funny, silly, harmless lot<br>
Those Haverbros we love a lot.<br>
For where would all the Bi-Co be<br>
Without their positivity?<br>
Haverbros, we salute to you,<br>
Our bros so noble and so true.<br>

## The F--kboy  
by Becca Garfinkle, Bryn Mawr ‘20
 
An F-CKBOY there was, upon the grounds, <br>
In shorts in all seasons was he found<br>
No matter if snow should land, <br>
The shorts he wore, always at hand.<br> 
Upon his feet he wore some slides<br>
From Adidas that were his pride,  <br>
With socks or not, it did not matter, <br>
So long as his steps did not clatter. <br>
His hair was in great need of a trim,<br>
Hidden underneath his hat’s brim<br>
It mattered not for no one could see. <br>
Despite his college’s great plea, <br>
He rode everywhere upon his board, <br>
On it he placed a sticker hoard. <br>
His shirt always said Supreme, <br>
Like the others on his team. <br>
They shot the balls into the hoop<br> 
And always traveled as a group. <br>
Of average were his looks, <br>
He ignored all of his books, <br>
Instead he spent the day swiping<br>
Left and right, before typing, <br>
“Hey girl, you’re so hot”  <br>
A girl he has never caught. <br>
To think he studies communications, <br>
To live up to his father’s expectations,<br> 
He dreams of taking over the firm;<br>
His father always makes him squirm, <br>
When he gets the credit card bill, <br>
His son he wants to kill,<br>
When he sees how much cash<br>
His son has spent all on trash. <br>
The red solo cups he buys in bulk, <br>
With his team they always sulk, <br>
For their parties no one attends <br>
Because they have no other friends. <br>
Ladies if you see him stay away, <br>
I promise you he is no good lay.  <br>

## The Student-Athlete  
By Aine Carolan, Haverford ‘20

At Haverford there was a coy STUDENT-ATHLETE;<br>
The classic jock description his character did not meet.<br>
He looked the part: tall, emblazoned with the Ford logo,<br>
But the unpleasant demeanor he did forgo.<br>
He must juggle two very different vocations<br>
Because of his love for lacrosse and for education.<br>
He begins the day early with a few hours of exercise,<br>
Then heads to the Coop for the breakfast he buys.<br>
He refocuses his mind on his second passion,<br>
The English language, which he writes in such a fashion<br>
That reading his essays is a godsend for his professors<br>
Who usually act toward athletes as harsh assessors.<br>
He flips zealously through Steinbeck and Walker<br>
Before he returns yet again to his athletic locker.<br>
There he dons his pads, his helmet; he grabs his stick<br>
And out to the field he goes to run some defensive picks.<br>
After practice, he returns the gear to their hooks,<br>
Starting where he left off with his pen and notebooks.<br>
Settling into bed, looking down at his cleats,<br>
He goes to sleep happy he can awake and repeat.<br>
This boy of twenty-one, who is perhaps barely a man,<br>
Is astutely aware many think he is completely deadpan.<br>
Of towering stature and team attire, he is indistinguishable <br>
But his enthusiasm for his studies is inextinguishable.<br>
He greets all who he sees, athletes and scholars alike<br>
As he zooms through the campus atop his blue bike. <br>
Many are quick to conclude he sticks to the team flank,<br>
And accuse him of thinking he is of high social rank.<br>
But with kindness and humor he makes his rounds,<br>
Bringing much-needed positivity to campus grounds. <br>
He is most accurately described as charming and empathetic,<br>
The impression you may first get of him is only an aesthetic. <br>

## the academic  
by Aurora Lewis, Haverford ‘19 
 
i met you in your office, which was three <br>
floors up in an antiquarian house <br>
sinking into the ground more quickly than <br>
venice. i imagined one day, perhaps <br>
even before i graduated, the <br>
earth would swallow up the place completely. <br>
the earthworms would rejoice for that <br>
historic, meaty fuel—the eaves that <br>
bespoke character and a history <br>
of rain, the worn velvet chairs in the lounge<br>
downstairs that witnessed years of crossed thighs. <br>
or else i met you in the stem building, <br>
an austere affair of glass and iron, <br>
which rose with modern angles from the ground <br>
and echoed slightly, like heart chambers. i <br>
always imagined that as i walked, feet <br>
clacking on the cool floors, a splash of <br>
color in a white, white hall—a bloodless <br>
heart, a heart pumping air. <br>
there are two ways this story could go. i <br>
could climb up three floors and sit and rejoice <br>
in joyce. or I could spin out atoms from<br>
imagination: carbon, nitrogen.<br>
are you stem or humanistic? <br>
should I say “Realistic” or “Book-Bound”?<br>
in tweed, a blazer, or a white lab coat?   <br>
your glasses are gold and wire-rimmed, or <br>
they are plastic safety goggles that leave <br>
red crescents on your cheeks. books,<br>
pages folded over and inked over,<br>
form the leaning tower on your desk, or<br>
else the periodic table has a <br>
home on your wall, next to a poster of<br>
darwin, biology’s own john lennon. <br>
the real question, though, is not the state of <br>
your clothes, or the manner of books that line <br>
your shelves. the real question is, can your <br>
un-common languages communicate? <br>
will idea-phobia be the <br>
xenophobia of academia, <br>
a lingering hypocrisy you cannot <br>
expunge completely? will you condone the<br>
lofty oaths of loyalty pledged by<br>
the pupils who build barricades out of<br>
lactate dehydrogenase and shelley?<br>
will you shelter in towers of ivory,<br>
utilize a jargon you guard with careful<br>
intent, as though it’s a do-it-yourself <br>
manual to Full Enlightenment? <br>
what really matters is this: will you raise a<br>
generation of thinkers un-thinking <br>
connections, un-crossing trajectories<br>
and reinforcing the safety of <br>
ready-made, pre-approved, straight lines of thought? <br>
you say you won’t—that you educate not<br>
obfuscate--but sometimes, i’m not so sure<br>
(i swear i want to believe you mean it)<br>
…but i don’t know…<br>
i hope not. <br>

## The Swiper 
By Marley Asplundh, Haverford '19<br>

The entrance of the DC is watched by a SWIPER<br>
Who metes out the fate of each hungry griper,<br>
Hoping they have meals to last the semester.<br>
If on you she has mercy, be sure to bless her.<br>
She sits on her stool as each eater walks by,<br>
Swiping, counting, charging, sometimes with a sigh,<br>
For when boorish students walk in without “thank you,”<br>
She still swipes folks through, even those who out rank you.<br>
Her hair always styled, her nails without chip,<br>
She’ll scroll through her phone keeping up with what’s hip.<br>
As well, she’ll check weather, because as all know,<br>
There’s nothing on earth she detests more than snow<br>
Or cold or wind on a sunnier day.<br>
“I’d vote for no winter, if I had my way!”<br>
This Swiper has watched us and helped us to food<br>
Since the first days we got here, so painfully new.<br>
Although we just see her but seconds a day,<br>
Her view is of us for each minute she stays<br>
At her post, on her perch, her hand in one motion<br>
While she dreams and talks of naught but the ocean.<br>
Though not much thanks she gets in this job,<br>
Hers is an importance unmatched by a mob.<br>

## The Pre-Med Student
By Hanna Kopits, Haverford ‘21<br>

See here the pre-med student, disheveled and unclean, <br>
Two hours or sleep, coffee, and forgetting to eat keeping her lean. <br>
The bags under her eyes larger than the one on her back, <br>
Internships apps, three labs a week, and professors cutting her no slack. <br>
Eight MCAT books piled high on her desk all preparing for one test<br>
As she works day and night and the stress allows her no rest.  <br>
Her parents hope that one day she’ll be a surgeon, <br>
All she wants to do is go through college and have friends like a real person. <br>
See her in the Sci-li doing problem sets until she cries, <br>
But she pretends to do it with ease, no one sees through her lies<br>
With her large coffee and iPad, she nods off in Orgo, <br>
Then realizes she has a lab quiz due during lunch and screams “OH NO,”<br>
She runs off in a panic, sprinting across Founder’s Green<br>
To beg for an extension from her professor without causing a scene.<br> 
Without close friends, she never goes out<br>
Friday or Saturday, she’s staying in without a doubt.<br>
Her backpack is stuffed to the bursting<br>
Of notebooks, textbooks, and a poster; she’s cursing<br>
Her choice of career at every chance,<br>
But puffs up with pride every time she’s asked<br>
“What’s your major?” from each new person she meets<br>
“I’m a Chem, Psych double major with a Biochem minor” and misses no beats.<br> 
The only thing she wishes for is twelve hours more in a day<br>
So that she can do independent research, in which she has a say.<br> 
Running reactions for seniors and pouring colorless liquids, <br>
Into test tubes and dishes. Her research is on lipids, <br>
And how a bilayer can be broken down using proteins that cleave. <br>
She spends her nights dreaming of everything she could achieve, <br>
At Harvard, or Hopkins, or NYU. <br>
But then she realizes that she still has to get through the next week or two.<br>
