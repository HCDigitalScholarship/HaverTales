## “Emma and The Blue Knights”   
by Becca Garfinkle, Bryn Mawr ‘20

In Athens, Georgia at the start of spring, 
All across the fields the lacrosse sticks swing. 
Two bros, Pal and Arc, fight for the Blue Knights. 
Together they have never had any fights. 
Until, a girl they both saw in math class. 
Arc called dibs, as he is a total ass.
Pal challenged him as he saw Emma first. 
Emma was not consulted. Men are the worst. 
Seuss, the team captain, decided on the clash. 
Polly, his girlfriend, agreed in a flash. 
Emma dragged by her sister would attend, 
Although she would leave without a boyfriend. 
They both picked teams for the battle to come, 
Pal picked first, Litty, a nice guy but glum. 
Arc chose, Trey, who’s as quick as a leopard. 
Seuss gathered a crowd like a proud shepherd. 

Pal hears the crowd outside the locker room, 
The chatter and murmurs fill him with doom. 
He thinks only of her, not the battle. 
Love Actually and Sleepless in Seattle, 
Were his inspiration to catch her eye. 
Wearing the rose cologne his mom made him buy, 
He anxiously checks his Twitter feed. 
What to say to ensure he would succeed? 
"I really like her, I hope she says yes!
#lovewins #romcom." But he could only guess. 
He should have gotten flowers, red or white? 
He couldn’t decide neither was quite right. 
It mattered not, there was only one goal, 
An alluring girl to take on a stroll. 

Emma sat in the stands texting away,
 Ignoring the match as the boys would play. 
Polly nudges her, “Which one do you prefer?” 
Emma shrugs, “Neither, both, they’re a blur.” 
“You aren’t hoping for a new friend?” 
“Those friends always disappoint in the end.” 
“Why did you even come if not to choose?” 
“To put it plainly I came to refuse. 
These boys think a lacrosse game will win me?
As if, only I can choose who to see.
I pick no one.” Emma would not be swayed. 
Polly chewed her lip hoping to persuade,  
 “At least keep your mind open. Take this quiz.” 
“Buzzfeed? Really? Those tests are all a swizz.” 
Polly persisted and Emma started the test. 
‘First, which wild animal do you like best?’ 
The king of the forest, the gentle stag. 
‘Alright select your favorite tea bag.’ 
Emma clicked away, question by question. 
The results proclaimed, “Here’s a confession, 
You are dying to meet that special someone.” 
Polly squealed, “Well wouldn’t that be fun.” 
“I would rather keep clear of all the guys.” 
“You don’t know that. A quiz never lies.” 
Emma doubted that. She didn’t want a boy, 
But if he was true she wouldn't play coy.

Arc shot the ball, it crashed into the net.
He would win, he had to, Pal was no threat. 
The weekend was spent with blistered fingers, 
The only break to craft nifty zingers. 
Pal would be crushed like in their Black Ops games. 
He would be the champ or go down in flames. 
A wicked idea came to Arc, to goad Pal, 
Send him a malicious Tweet he shall. 
He retrieved his cell phone, a blood red beast, 
“My fury on the field will be unleashed, 
I will be the winner there is no doubt. 
#ballislife #itsgonnabeashutout.” 
With polished white gear, he turns to the field, 
Ready to face Pal, crosse held as a shield. 

It is now time the battle will commence,
The foes stand opposed. The crowd is all tense. 
Two of three goals will make them a winner
And see who will take Emma for dinner. 
Seuss judges the face off, “I want a clean game.” 
Arc grabbed the ball first with an air of fame, 
Dodge, sprint, a quick dance, the ball strikes the net. 
The first point is done, Arc didn’t break a sweat. 
Pal has the ball now, a flick of the wrist, 
A pass to Litty, who has never missed. 
Just like that two goals, one to one, a tie, 
In quick succession, both shots a bull’s eye. 

The last round, one point left, still anyone’s game. 
The crowd is jubilant, Emma mutters “Lame.” 
Pal and Arc circle, tension hung heavy,  
Emotion crashing against the levee. 
Pal moved first, snatching the ball from the ground. 
Arc followed, Pal dodged, but he was surrounded. 
Trey checked Pal, hard, he was knocked to the dirt,
Dirtied and bruised but otherwise unhurt. 
Arc scoops the ball, tosses it straight to the net, 
The third point, Arc had won. He had no regrets. 

Pal lays in the dirt, resound in his fate. 
Arc walks to Pal, “Thought you could win mate?
We both know I’m the better player, 
And I’m known as a lady slayer.” 
He winks at Emma. She has heard it all, 
She stormed over. She would be his downfall. 
“Ah my Emily, ready for a date?” 
“It’s Emma. You are as dumb as slate.” 
Arc was taken aback, “But I won you?” 
“A person cannot be won, you cuckoo!
I would never date someone so graceless. 
Men like you are society’s abscess.” 
Arc blinked at her slowly, “So it’s a no?” 
“Yes it’s a no, go give your ball a throw.” 
Emma helped Pal up, “How are you feeling?” 
“Fine, but I think my pride is still reeling.” 
Emma smiled, “Want to go get a coffee?
I want to try this new one with toffee.” 

Pal and Emma depart. Arc is stricken, 
He is as lost as a headless chicken. 
The team approaches, “Bro she just murdered you!” 
“Shut up! You are supposed to be my crew.” 
“Okay, but dude, she came and ended your life.” 
“Doesn’t matter, Pal can have the strife.” 
Thus ends the tale of the two Blue Knights, 
Pal and Emma see all the city’s lights, 
While Arc was slain by a slight fair maid, 
All after one short lacrosse game was played.
