title: "The General Prologue"
---

What that Aprill with his shoures sote
The drought of Marche hath perced to the rote…
Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimage…

In “The General Prologue,” the narrator of The Canterbury Tales explains how the coming of Spring inspires people to go on pilgrimage. He meets a group of pilgrims at an inn, joins their company, and offers a detailed description of each member of the group. The narrator’s portraits are vivid and often satirical. Clothes, facial features, and behaviors are loaded with clues about social rank and commentary on spiritual health.  


The Campus Canterbury Tales 

The portraits below were prepared by the students of ENG 201. Students responded to the following prompt:

Imagine that you are preparing to write “The Campus Canterbury Tales.” Write a portrait of a “character” that you might see walking around on campus such as the English Major, the Frat Boy, or the Nerd. Consider how Chaucer makes the pilgrims in his “General Prologue” vivid and memorable and try to incorporate these techniques into your portrait. Your write-up should be about 200-400 words (about the length of Chaucer’s portraits) and you may choose to write in verse or in prose.    

Money Motivated
by Jacob Landsberg, Haverford ‘21

A business student there was, as driven as they come,
He spent his days in accounting, calculating sums.
Yet, a second in class was a second misspent,
Especially with networking events to frequent.
After all, when C’s get degrees,
Why would he waste time with Socrates?
In a world where cash is king,
“Business major” sure had a nice ring.
With December arrived the flurry of snow,
As his job interviews began to grow,
He longed for a job that would overpay
At Goldman or maybe B of A.
Waiting for his interviewer, palms sweating
Hoping for that water the receptionist was getting.
He had practiced his handshake a thousand times,
Up the corporate ladder, he hoped to climb.
He’d left econ to the academics and tryhards,
Business, he knew, was the way into Vanguard.
He was certainly worthy of the position,
His LinkedIn page alone warranted admission.
He’d put away his khakis and his polos—all in pink,
Now he sat in suit and tie, complete with cufflinks,
A jacket of black with pants to match,
Shoes shone, without even a scratch,
A white shirt, freshly ironed, and his look was done
Straight out of “How to Get a Job, 101.”
Yet, if he missed out on the job, it wouldn’t be too bad,
He could always work at JP Morgan, thanks to dad.


The Pokémon Go Player
by Helena Frisbie-Firsching, Haverford ‘21
 
There was a fellow arriving to Cope Field,
A group of folks following at his heels.
A battle they were to have, on the app
Pokémon Go against the foe, pinap
Berries used in the catch. Clad in warm hat
And coat and red scarf, his outfit down pat
To withstand the cold but also tap quick
His phone screen and of his Pokémon pick
A team with type advantage for the raid.
He often comes to the motley group’s aid,
In his pack is a portable charger;
Cold’s unkind to phones. It’s bad to wager
Raid rewards on batteries of low charge.
His charging cable collection is large;
He can lend for any model or make,
If his Instinct gym they will not soon take.
A normal glove or mitten he has none
Rather the fingerless kind, which are fun
And practical, so that he can keep most
Of his hand comfortably warm, yet boast,
Having dealt the most damage to Ho-Oh.
And for this game which dearly he loves so,
He will abandon his schoolwork for quests,
Loitering at Stokes, not getting much rest.
He is a physics major, as most are,
His shoes worn from not traveling by car.
Many kilometers a week walks he
To hatch eggs and maybe catch a shiny.
Always with his phone out and looking down,
He scuttles his way throughout Havertown.


The Haverbro
by Caroline Ford, Haverford ‘21
 
A HAVERBRO there was, an athlete, at that,
A popular social caste in absence of a frat.
Truly one who values social status and skill;
This athlete cares most for FIFA and chill.
A white boy, ™, with dirty blond hair,
Tall in his stature, and pale face shaved bare.
A regular at the GIAC to lift weights and run
When outside of practices to condition,
Always trying to remain hydrated
With a gallon water jug, rather weighted.
On the DC’s right side he, with Gatorade in hand,
Would oft sit and embody the Nike brand.
Lacrosse stick looped through his navy backpack,
A ‘Ford sweatshirt he sported, bright red and black,
Preppy Lacoste shorts, with Adidas shoes to match,
So that any girl would think him quite a catch.
A white snapback worn low atop his head
While he sat with his legs generously spread;
His position conveying confidence
In both frank manner and ego immense,
Surrounded by many of his fellow bros
Discussing economics, I suppose.
And alas, when the weekend arrives again, 
As parties come around, every now and then;
A champion of pong, he plays through the night,
And well can he consume much Natty Lite.
He is full ready to drink, juul, and dance,
And perhaps give his homework just one glance.


The Haverbro 
by Gwynne Dulaney, Bryn Mawr ‘20
 
There was but once a Haverbro
Who loved to compliment his flow
With slick hair gel and rich pomade
So that his flow would never fade.
On his shirt ‘twas so finely embossed
His team name for baseball or lacrosse.
And maybe a hoodie intended to match
So that he would thus be considered a catch.
And Airbuds placed within his ears
So hoots and cries he could not hear.
He was well-versed in all the sports
Made clear to all by his fine gym shorts.
For always this man looked never meek
But always buff and quite on-fleek.
He was down to party, and shed a tear
If ever there lacked some ice-cold beer.
And all he greeted in much good mood
With a deep and illustrious cry of, “dude!”
He showed his love but on a whim
With offers to hit the Gardner gym.
A worldly man, of deep deep thought
He made it clear he knew a lot.
For only a man who’s not a fool
Knows it best to smoke a Juul.
For no man of wit would willingly beget
The health problems brought on by a cigarette.
These bits of wisdom were brought to be
By majoring in philosophy.
And every day, like fine clockwork he went-y
To eat ample amounts of chicken tendies.
And all girls nearby would be in fear and dreading
Of that much-too-common thing they call man-spreading.
One thing bound to set him in a rage
Was the unfair elimination of the stage
That graced the room of the good DC
How silly could this dear bro be?
A funny, silly, harmless lot
Those Haverbros we love a lot.
For where would all the Bi-Co be
Without their positivity?
Haverbros, we salute to you,
Our bros so noble and so true.


The F--kboy
by Becca Garfinkle, Bryn Mawr ‘20
 
An F-CKBOY there was, upon the grounds, 
In shorts in all seasons was he found
No matter if snow should land, 
The shorts he wore, always at hand. 
Upon his feet he wore some slides
From Adidas that were his pride,  
With socks or not, it did not matter, 
So long as his steps did not clatter. 
His hair was in great need of a trim,
Hidden underneath his hat’s brim
It mattered not for no one could see. 
Despite his college’s great plea, 
He rode everywhere upon his board, 
On it he placed a sticker hoard. 
His shirt always said Supreme, 
Like the others on his team. 
They shot the balls into the hoop 
And always traveled as a group. 
Of average were his looks, 
He ignored all of his books, 
Instead he spent the day swiping
Left and right, before typing, 
“Hey girl, you’re so hot”  
A girl he has never caught. 
To think he studies communications, 
To live up to his father’s expectations, 
He dreams of taking over the firm;
His father always makes him squirm, 
When he gets the credit card bill, 
His son he wants to kill,
When he sees how much cash
His son has spent all on trash. 
The red solo cups he buys in bulk, 
With his team they always sulk, 
For their parties no one attends 
Because they have no other friends. 
Ladies if you see him stay away, 
I promise you he is no good lay.  


The Student-Athlete
By Aine Carolan, Haverford ‘20

At Haverford there was a coy STUDENT-ATHLETE;
The classic jock description his character did not meet.
He looked the part: tall, emblazoned with the Ford logo,
But the unpleasant demeanor he did forgo.
He must juggle two very different vocations
Because of his love for lacrosse and for education.
He begins the day early with a few hours of exercise,
Then heads to the Coop for the breakfast he buys.
He refocuses his mind on his second passion,
The English language, which he writes in such a fashion
That reading his essays is a godsend for his professors
Who usually act toward athletes as harsh assessors.
He flips zealously through Steinbeck and Walker
Before he returns yet again to his athletic locker.
There he dons his pads, his helmet; he grabs his stick
And out to the field he goes to run some defensive picks.
After practice, he returns the gear to their hooks,
Starting where he left off with his pen and notebooks.
Settling into bed, looking down at his cleats,
He goes to sleep happy he can awake and repeat.
This boy of twenty-one, who is perhaps barely a man,
Is astutely aware many think he is completely deadpan.
Of towering stature and team attire, he is indistinguishable 
But his enthusiasm for his studies is inextinguishable.
He greets all who he sees, athletes and scholars alike
As he zooms through the campus atop his blue bike. 
Many are quick to conclude he sticks to the team flank,
And accuse him of thinking he is of high social rank.
But with kindness and humor he makes his rounds,
Bringing much-needed positivity to campus grounds. 
He is most accurately described as charming and empathetic,
The impression you may first get of him is only an aesthetic. 

the academic
by Aurora Lewis, Haverford ‘19 
 
i met you in your office, which was three 
floors up in an antiquarian house 
sinking into the ground more quickly than 
venice. i imagined one day, perhaps 
even before i graduated, the 
earth would swallow up the place completely. 
the earthworms would rejoice for that 
historic, meaty fuel—the eaves that 
bespoke character and a history 
of rain, the worn velvet chairs in the lounge
downstairs that witnessed years of crossed thighs. 
or else i met you in the stem building, 
an austere affair of glass and iron, 
which rose with modern angles from the ground 
and echoed slightly, like heart chambers. i 
always imagined that as i walked, feet 
clacking on the cool floors, a splash of 
color in a white, white hall—a bloodless 
heart, a heart pumping air. 
there are two ways this story could go. i 
could climb up three floors and sit and rejoice 
in joyce. or I could spin out atoms from
imagination: carbon, nitrogen.
are you stem or humanistic? 
should I say “Realistic” or “Book-Bound”?
in tweed, a blazer, or a white lab coat?   
your glasses are gold and wire-rimmed, or 
they are plastic safety goggles that leave
red crescents on your cheeks. books,
pages folded over and inked over,
form the leaning tower on your desk, or
else the periodic table has a 
home on your wall, next to a poster of
darwin, biology’s own john lennon. 
the real question, though, is not the state of 
your clothes, or the manner of books that line 
your shelves. the real question is, can your 
un-common languages communicate? 
will idea-phobia be the 
xenophobia of academia, 
a lingering hypocrisy you cannot 
expunge completely? will you condone the
lofty oaths of loyalty pledged by
the pupils who build barricades out of
lactate dehydrogenase and shelley?
will you shelter in towers of ivory,
utilize a jargon you guard with careful
intent, as though it’s a do-it-yourself 
manual to Full Enlightenment? 
what really matters is this: will you raise a
generation of thinkers un-thinking 
connections, un-crossing trajectories
and reinforcing the safety of 
ready-made, pre-approved, straight lines of thought? 
you say you won’t—that you educate not
obfuscate--but sometimes, i’m not so sure
(i swear i want to believe you mean it)
…but i don’t know…
i hope not.
