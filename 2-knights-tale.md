## “Emma and The Blue Knights”   
by Becca Garfinkle, Bryn Mawr ‘20

In Athens, Georgia at the start of spring, <br>
All across the fields the lacrosse sticks swing. <br>
Two bros, Pal and Arc, fight for the Blue Knights. <br>
Together they have never had any fights. <br>
Until, a girl they both saw in math class. <br>
Arc called dibs, as he is a total ass.<br>
Pal challenged him as he saw Emma first. <br>
Emma was not consulted. Men are the worst. <br>
Seuss, the team captain, decided on the clash. <br>
Polly, his girlfriend, agreed in a flash. <br>
Emma dragged by her sister would attend, <br>
Although she would leave without a boyfriend.<br> 
They both picked teams for the battle to come, <br>
Pal picked first, Litty, a nice guy but glum. <br>
Arc chose, Trey, who’s as quick as a leopard. <br>
Seuss gathered a crowd like a proud shepherd. <br>

Pal hears the crowd outside the locker room, <br>
The chatter and murmurs fill him with doom. <br>
He thinks only of her, not the battle. <br>
Love Actually and Sleepless in Seattle, <br>
Were his inspiration to catch her eye. <br>
Wearing the rose cologne his mom made him buy, <br>
He anxiously checks his Twitter feed. <br>
What to say to ensure he would succeed? <br>
"I really like her, I hope she says yes!<br>
#lovewins #romcom." But he could only guess.<br> 
He should have gotten flowers, red or white? <br>
He couldn’t decide neither was quite right. <br>
It mattered not, there was only one goal, <br>
An alluring girl to take on a stroll. <br>

Emma sat in the stands texting away,<br>
 Ignoring the match as the boys would play. <br>
Polly nudges her, “Which one do you prefer?” <br>
Emma shrugs, “Neither, both, they’re a blur.” <br>
“You aren’t hoping for a new friend?” <br>
“Those friends always disappoint in the end.” <br>
“Why did you even come if not to choose?” <br>
“To put it plainly I came to refuse. <br>
These boys think a lacrosse game will win me?<br>
As if, only I can choose who to see.<br>
I pick no one.” Emma would not be swayed. <br>
Polly chewed her lip hoping to persuade,  <br>
 “At least keep your mind open. Take this quiz.” <br>
“Buzzfeed? Really? Those tests are all a swizz.” <br>
Polly persisted and Emma started the test. <br>
‘First, which wild animal do you like best?’ <br>
The king of the forest, the gentle stag. <br>
‘Alright select your favorite tea bag.’ <br>
Emma clicked away, question by question. <br>
The results proclaimed, “Here’s a confession,<br> 
You are dying to meet that special someone.” <br>
Polly squealed, “Well wouldn’t that be fun.” <br>
“I would rather keep clear of all the guys.” <br>
“You don’t know that. A quiz never lies.” <br>
Emma doubted that. She didn’t want a boy, <br>
But if he was true she wouldn't play coy.<br>

Arc shot the ball, it crashed into the net.<br>
He would win, he had to, Pal was no threat. <br>
The weekend was spent with blistered fingers, <br>
The only break to craft nifty zingers. <br>
Pal would be crushed like in their Black Ops games. <br>
He would be the champ or go down in flames. <br>
A wicked idea came to Arc, to goad Pal, <br>
Send him a malicious Tweet he shall. <br>
He retrieved his cell phone, a blood red beast, <br>
“My fury on the field will be unleashed, <br>
I will be the winner there is no doubt. <br>
#ballislife #itsgonnabeashutout.” <br>
With polished white gear, he turns to the field, <br>
Ready to face Pal, crosse held as a shield. <br>

It is now time the battle will commence,<br>
The foes stand opposed. The crowd is all tense. <br>
Two of three goals will make them a winner<br>
And see who will take Emma for dinner. <br>
Seuss judges the face off, “I want a clean game.” <br>
Arc grabbed the ball first with an air of fame, <br>
Dodge, sprint, a quick dance, the ball strikes the net. <br>
The first point is done, Arc didn’t break a sweat. <br>
Pal has the ball now, a flick of the wrist, <br>
A pass to Litty, who has never missed. <br>
Just like that two goals, one to one, a tie, <br>
In quick succession, both shots a bull’s eye. <br>

The last round, one point left, still anyone’s game. <br>
The crowd is jubilant, Emma mutters “Lame.” <br>
Pal and Arc circle, tension hung heavy,  <br>
Emotion crashing against the levee. <br>
Pal moved first, snatching the ball from the ground. <br>
Arc followed, Pal dodged, but he was surrounded. <br>
Trey checked Pal, hard, he was knocked to the dirt,<br>
Dirtied and bruised but otherwise unhurt. <br>
Arc scoops the ball, tosses it straight to the net, <br>
The third point, Arc had won. He had no regrets. <br>

Pal lays in the dirt, resound in his fate. <br>
Arc walks to Pal, “Thought you could win mate? <br>
We both know I’m the better player, <br>
And I’m known as a lady slayer.” <br>
He winks at Emma. She has heard it all, <br>
She stormed over. She would be his downfall.<br> 
“Ah my Emily, ready for a date?” <br>
“It’s Emma. You are as dumb as slate.” <br>
Arc was taken aback, “But I won you?” <br>
“A person cannot be won, you cuckoo!<br>
I would never date someone so graceless. <br>
Men like you are society’s abscess.” <br>
Arc blinked at her slowly, “So it’s a no?” <br>
“Yes it’s a no, go give your ball a throw.” <br>
Emma helped Pal up, “How are you feeling?” <br>
“Fine, but I think my pride is still reeling.” <br>
Emma smiled, “Want to go get a coffee?<br>
I want to try this new one with toffee.” <br>

Pal and Emma depart. Arc is stricken, <br>
He is as lost as a headless chicken. <br>
The team approaches, “Bro she just murdered you!” <br>
“Shut up! You are supposed to be my crew.” <br>
“Okay, but dude, she came and ended your life.”<br> 
“Doesn’t matter, Pal can have the strife.” <br>
Thus ends the tale of the two Blue Knights, <br>
Pal and Emma see all the city’s lights, <br>
While Arc was slain by a slight fair maid, <br>
All after one short lacrosse game was played. <br>
